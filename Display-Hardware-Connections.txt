Project - DOGS102-6 GRAPHIC to STM32G071 Nucleo board 

Required hardware
================
   Platform = STM32G071 Nucleo board and DOGS102-6 GRAPHIC 
   
   
 
Wiring:
	22 and 23 and 27 to 3.3v
	20 and 21 to GND
	16 to Capacitor to 19
	17 to Capacitor to 18
	(Named Pins to display)
	PA1 to 25 (clk)
	PA4 to 28 (Chip Select)
	PA5 to 26 (CD)
	PA12 to 24 (MOSI)
			
		
Things to check:
	1) Check the GND is actually connected
	2) Check power is still connected to board and display
	3) Check capacitors are still connected properly (16 to 19 and 17 to 18)
	4) Check your CD line is properly connected
	5) Check the selection lines connection
